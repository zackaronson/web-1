	<h5>Co-Founder/Designer, Foot Canvas | 2013-2017</h5>
	<p>My father is a Podiatrist, I am a designer and we both love footwear. We combined our talents and our love of sneakers to create a custom graphic insole to be worn by sneakerheads. I headed the creative side (website, print materials, social media) and he headed the technical specs of the insole. I spearheaded every touchpoint for Foot Canvas and the insole designs worn by Beyonce, Colin Kaepernick, DJ Clark Kent, Ric Flair and many more. Also, we currently have a patent pending on the insole concept. </p>

	<h5>UI Designer, Speakup The App | 2014-2015</h5>
	<p>Imagine a selfie video app meets Quora, authenticity meets social media. I wore a number of hats at this early stage startup but was mainly interested in the core features of the app. I worked endless hours on a new way to discover and reply to video selfies. Not to mention make the app fun and easy enough to use but serious enough to have meaningful conversations. Speakup reached over 30k downloads in the iTunes App Store and was featured in tech blogs such as TechCrunch and The Verge. </p>
